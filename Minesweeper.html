        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p> Use the left click button on the mouse to select a space on the grid. If you hit a bunny, you wake it up and lose. </p>
        <p> You can right click a square with the mouse to place a carrot where you think a bunny is. This allows you to avoid that spot. </p>
        <p>The numbers on the board represent how many bunnies are adjacent to a square. For example, if a square has a "3" on it, then there are 3 bunnies next to that square. The bunnies could be above, below, right left, or diagonal to the square.</p>  
        Avoid all the bunnies and expose all the empty spaces to win Sleepy Bunnies.</p>
            
        <p>Tip: Use the numbers to determine where you know a bunny is.</p>
